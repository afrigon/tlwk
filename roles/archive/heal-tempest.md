[Heal Tempest Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PGhEgEWGBrh5wWYlYpNp3aB-zRRYjhoaXNaq1IKjqLg0TAfPICQ6fKbgDgt0+mF-e)

## Key Skills

- `Aftershock`
- `Flash-Freeze`
- `Eye of the Storm`
- `Feel the Burn`
- `Wash the Pain Away`
- `Rebound`
- `Heat Sync` / Fire Warhorn 4
- `Sand Squall` / Earth Warhorn 4
- `Glyph of Renewal`
- `Overloads`

## Boon Responsability

The elementalist brings protection, regeneration, might, fury, alacrity, vigor and swiftness for 5 players.

### Protection

This is the most important boon to apply, the elementalist brings protection for the entire squad with `Aftershock` and `Sand Squall`. Any overload will also grant protection.

### Might

Use the fire overload to stack might and blast your fire field using `Aftershock` and `Sand Squell`. Abuse `Heat Sync` / Fire Warhorn 4 to copy **ALL** of your might to nearby allies (adds on top of currently applied might).

### Alacrity

The trait `Lucid Singularity` will provide alacrity to your party as a side effect of overloads.

### Regeneration and Vigor

The regeneration and vigor boons can be provided simply by using `Aftershock`, `Sand Squall`, `Feel the Burn` and `Flash-Freeze` since you have the trait `Invigorating Torrents` that gives regeneration and vigor for 10 seconds when you apply an aura.

### Fury and Swiftness

The fury and swiftness boons can be provided simply by using `Aftershock`, `Sand Squall`, `Feel the Burn` and `Flash-Freeze` since you have the trait `Zephyr's Boon` that gives fury and swiftness for 10 seconds when you apply an aura.

### Extension

One of your most powerful ability is `Sand Squall` to extend all boons currently applied to everyone in the squad for 3 seconds.

### Superspeed

You can get access to superspeed by taking `Eye of the Storm`. While this can be very good on most fights, be extremely careful to not give this buff on fights where it could kill your teamates like Cardinal Adina or Escort.

## Healing

The elementalist will be in charge of all the healing on most bosses. Make sure to go into water regularly to refresh the `Soothing mist` buff on everyone. In high pressure situation, use `Wash the pain away`, `Water Globe` / Water Warhorn 5 > `Frozen Burst` / Water Dagger 3 or water overload for a burst of heal.

## Magnetic Aura

- `Aftershock`
- `Sand Squall`
- `Rebound`

> Be sure to never grant magnetic aura on fights where reflect can be bad like cairn and matthias.

## Rebound

This is one of your strongest skill, it can save the group from a wipe in many cases like:

- Deimos: Mind Crush
- Conjured Amalgamate: Clap
- your mom: Clap
- Quadim: Failed CC
- Cardinal Sabir: Shockwave

## Crowd Control

- `Cyclone` / Air Warhorn 4 (up to 9 hits of 150)
- `Transmute Lightning` / Air Dagger 3 (100)
- `Tidal Surge` / Water Warhorn 4 (150)

### Immobilize

- `Aftershock`
- `Earthen Rush` / Earth Dagger 3

### Cripple

- `Aftershock`
- `Ring of Earth` / Earth Dagger 2

### Chill

- `Flash-Freeze`
- `Frozen Burst` / Water Dagger 3

## Alternate Tank

Since the build uses minstrel gear,
the elementalist player is the alternate tank for emergency situations
(eg. main tank dies or disconnect).

## Special Roles

### Escort

You are in charge of Glenouche. Use the special action to move her ahead.

### Twisted Castle

For this encounter, swap your warhorn for a dagger to get access to `Ride the Lightning`. (Air Dagger 4)
This will allow you to perform the skip the druid usualy does in pug groups.

### Samarog

You are in charge to keep Rigom [Immobilized](#immobilize). Make sure you keep applying soft crowd control effect onto Guldhem as they will be transfered to Rigom.

### Deimos

Make sure you keep Saul healthy.

### Twin Largos Kite

You should stay further out to kite the steal attack from Kenut. Dodge the hit to avoid getting your boons stolen.

### Quadim Matriarch Tank

- Starts when qadim reaches 33% health
- Stay alive until Zommorros takes over
- Walk out of the flame breath
- Walk out of the `Wing Buffet` and make sure the wyvern is facing away from the group
- Sidestep the `Tail Swipe`
- Avoid the `Slash` by dodging the sideways punch (kockback) and being inside the hitbox to avoid the downward punch.
- Follow and continue tanking if the wyvern moves.

## Wing 5

The elementalist will swap to ranger for all of Hall of Chains.

### Soulless Horror Pusher

Your job on this encounter is to push the tormented dead outside the arena. They will be following the tank currently **not** fixated. Position yourself in a way that allows you you to push them out before they reach the group using `Glyph of Tides` and `Point-Blank Shot`.

### Eye of Judgment / Fate

Your job here is to keep the eye stuned using the `Light orb` skill 2: `Flare`. Keep an eye on the stun duration and use a light to refresh it before it runs out. Use a sigil of paralization and `Moment of Clarity` to extend the duration of the stun.

[Example](https://youtu.be/wTn-TJbNWWw?t=336) - [Druid Stun Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?POxEY6MsMBWCThhwIxxfyrZNi4A-zRJYqR9fh0SBUdUleq67BJU28vl23sA-e)

### Dhuum Kite Green 2

The kiter job on Dhuum is to tap the messengers and take them for a walk away from the group. During the pre-event, be aware of affliction bombs as they might kill you if you are low health. Additionaly, you are in charge of [green 2](/mechanics/dhuum-green.md). Someone else will backup your first green.

> You can take some toughness to make this more reliable.
