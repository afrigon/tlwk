## Special Roles

### Escort Back Warg

Handle the back wargs chasing the group. Bring immobilize to make the job easier.

### Deimos Hand Kite

The warrior is hand kiting on deimos. By being the furthest player away from the boss, you will be able to stack hands near the edge of the arena.

Simple rotation to stack 5 hands:
1. Facetank the first hand.
2. Use `Counterblow` / mace 2 to block the second hand.
3. Use `Full Counter` / F2 to get an evade frame for the third and fourth hand.
4. Dodge out of the hand stack to evade the fifth hand.
5. Swap weapon to get a small heal from your sigil.

Mind crush:
Use `Shield Stance` / Shield 5 to block the `Mind Crush` and chain it with your heal skill `Defiant Stance` to sustain the following Damage over Time effect from `Weak Minded`.

`Endure Pain` is your panic button.

### Eye of Judgment / Fate

Your job here is to keep the eye stuned using the `Light orb` skill 2: `Flare`. Keep an eye on the stun duration and use a light to refresh it before it runs out. Use a sigil of paralization to extend the duration of the stun.

### Dhuum Green 1

You're in charge of [green 1](/mechanics/dhuum-green.md). Make sure to use `Scorched Earth` on the star reaper to clear out spiders.
