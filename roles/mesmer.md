# Mesmer

For fights with toughness tanking mechanic, you should run a build similar to this one to make sure you will never die and have the most toughness.

## Boon Responsability

### Quickness

The mesmer player brings quickness
for their subgroup with `Seize the moment` and `Well of Action`.
Casting `Time Warp` as soon as the fight start to apply quickness to the entire squad is a good idea.

### Aegis

You have access to aegis for your subgroup through the synergy between `Inpiring Distortion` and `Blurred inscription` whenever you use a signet. If more aegis is required, you can bring `Well of Precognition`.

### Extension

One of your most powerful ability is `Signet of Inspiration` to extend all boons currently applied to everyone in the squad for 3 seconds.

## Crowd Control

- `Into the Void` / Focus 4 (150)
- `Tides of Time` / Shield 5 (up to 2 hits of 100)
- `Illusionary Wave` / Greatsword 5 (150)
- `Counter Blade` / Sword 4 (200)
- `Magic Bullet` / Pistol 5 (200)
- `Time Sink` / F3 (100 per clone)
- `Signet of Humility` (600)
- `Gravity Well` (300/100/150 for first, second and third pulse)
- `Signet of Domination` (300)

## Portals

### Spirit Wood

You can portal the team from a capture point to another by abusing the `Adrenal Mushrooms`.

### Spirit Run

After the glide in spirit run, you can portal the team from the capture point directly to the final wall using a double blink.

### Escort

You job is to risk your life and go through the cave to portal people up the tower.

> Don't fly in front of the tower or you will get kockbacked and die of falling damage.

### Twisted Castle

Make a portal to get to the lower section of `Twisted Castle` to make sure your team don't break their ankles. Aim a dodge roll at the top of the door with full health to survive. Watch your stack of `Madness` to make sure you don't take damage at the same time. (30 and 60 stacks)

### Quadim

For the burn phases, you will be responsible to port the entire group from quadim to the resolution pyre.

Another use for the portal is to skip the jumping puzzle after the wyvern phases.

## Tanking

The mesmer player is the main tank for all encounters. This is the reason why the default build has so much toughness. The job of the tank is to never die and keep the boss in place.

### Vale Guardian

- Never get ported (dodge into the wall, use `Blurred Frenzy` or walk out of the blues)
- Use distortion to avoid the green damage

### Keep Construct

- Kite the boss towards the left wall near the statue that is spawning a spirit to make sure we can quickly cleave it.

### Xera



### Deimos

- Always take the protective bubble unless the green is taking the entire space
- Use `Well of precognition` if you must facetank the `Mind Crush` attack
- Position yourself to not get knocked off the platform if you get hit (use geometry)
- Use a signet to share an aegis before the pizza attack. Dodge it if you are unsure about your distortion timing
- Move away from oils. Give some room for the dps players to do their jobs

### Soulless Horror

- Alternate tanking with the other tank; as a rule of thumb, take fixate as soon as your stacks of `Necrosis` wear off (30s after losing fix)
- Aim for both tanks to have up to 2 or 3 stacks of `Necrosis` at all time
- Position the boss halfway between the center and the edge of the arena to make pushing easier and have more time to react to walls
- Move quickly when a wall is going in your direction

### Broken King

- Face the boss away from the group
- The attack to avoid is a short range fan of ice shards. Stay further back to not take any damage
- If the boss is dealing damage on a green, face the boss away or take the green yourself using blocks and evades

### Eater of Souls

- Bring the boss on the marking that is lit up green at all times
- The attacks from the boss hurt quite a bit, make sure you block and evade most them

### Dhuum

### Twin Largos

- You're responsible for alacrity uptime on right side (Kenut)
- Drag the boss away from the tornados
- Face the boss away from the group

### Quadim

### Cardinal Adina

- Face the boss away from the group
- Watch out for the cone attack, it will knock you back. Use a block or bring stability from the Chaos traitline
- At 75%, 50% and 25% the stalagmite will explode and do massive damage 1 tile around them. Be far enough to avoid this damage

### Quadim the Peerless

- Use the Special Action Key to link to quadim and be the tank
- Quadim will do a cone attack followed by barrage of attacks after a few seconds 3 times in a row followed by a road attack. Make sure you have a block ready for all 3 (Ex: `Signet of Inspiration` / `Signet of the Ether` > `Blurred Frenzy`, `Echo of Memory`, `Deja Vu`) 
- Tank on the right side of the pylon so the kiter has safe space on the left side
- Position yourself on the left side between the pylon and the orb during the third barrage of attacks to drop the road (you can stack the roads on top of each other during `Deja Vu`)
- At 20%, make sure you are the first player in the circle to get fixation. You can stay close to quadim and dodge the kockback

## Special Roles

### Slothasor

You can use signets to gain distortion and jump inside slothasor during the shake to destroy most of the projectiles. This will reduce the fatality of this attack.

### Bandit Trio

Whenever you see the mortar warning message, use the launchpad and cc the adds preparing the mortar strike after you see a breakbar appear. Use `Into the Void` traited with `Delayed Reaction` to break them all at once.

### Mathias Gabrel

When Matthias gets a protective shield, use `Feedback` to reflect the shards back to break his shield.

### Keep Construct

Make sure you bring a greatsword or that you have a plan to push the orb through the rifts. Try and get 3 rifts and adjust the next phase according to the squad's damage. Push an extra rift for the last phase.

### Eye of Judgment / Fate

Stay on top of the wall, collect light orbs before they get stolen by adds, and use the skill 1: `Throw Light` to throw it to your subgroup. Throw the first one on the group and the next ones on the eye.

### Dhuum Backup First Green 2

Make sure to take the first [green 2](/mechanic/dhuum-green.md) on circle to free the kiter during the pre-event.

### Conjured Amalgamate Sword Collection

During the orb collection phase (when an arm dies), the mesmer player is in charge of collecting **all** 15 sword orbs. When you reach 5 stack of swords, position yourself to pick up the next one and cast them on the boss. (this will lock you in place for a second) Keep the 10 remaining stack to use on the arm if the boss is close to phase. (50% and 25%) Otherwise, use the 10 stack when the first 5 run out. The sword orbs start from the left when facing the boss.
