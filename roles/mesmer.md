## Boon Responsability

### Quickness

The mesmer player brings quickness
for their subgroup with `Seize the moment` and `Well of Action`.
Casting `Time Warp` as soon as the fight start to apply quickness to the party is a good idea.

### Aegis

You can bring `Well of Precognition` when aegis is required. You have access to more aegis for your subgroup through the synergy between `Inpiring Distortion` and `Blurred inscription` whenever you use a signet if necessary.

### Stability

You have access to stability with `Well of Precognition` and `Mantra of Concentration`.

## Crowd Control

- `Into the Void` / Focus 4 (150)
- `Tides of Time` / Shield 5 (up to 2 hits of 100)
- `Illusionary Wave` / Greatsword 5 (150)
- `Counter Blade` / Sword 4 (200)
- `Magic Bullet` / Pistol 5 (200)
- `Time Sink` / F3 (100 per clone)
- `Signet of Humility` (600)
- `Gravity Well` (300/100/150 for first, second and third pulse)
- `Signet of Domination` (300)

## Blocks, Evades and Distortion

- `Echo of Memory` / Shield 4 > `Deja Vu` / Shield 4 flip
- `Illusionary Riposte` / Sword 4
- `Blurred Frenzy` / Sword 2
- `Illusionary Counter` / Scepter 2
- Any Signet ability will give you 1s of distortion when using the ispiration traitline
- It's also legal to use a regular dodge roll

> You can abuse `Signet of the Ether` to restore your shield blocks.

## Portals

### Spirit Wood

- You can portal the team from a capture point to another by abusing the `Adrenal Mushrooms`.
- If you are tryhard you can `Continuum Split` one more portal in the spirit run.
- After the glide in spirit run, you can portal the team from the capture point directly to the final wall using a double blink.

[Example](https://youtu.be/u1r2K-o2zm4)

### Escort

You job is to risk your life and go through the cave to portal people up the tower. You can optionaly use the mirage traitline to leap in the cave.

> Don't fly in front of the tower or you will get kocked and die of falling damage.

[Example](https://youtu.be/d1Ryy7oBgno) - [Tower Chronomancer Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PixAw27lVwCZasLGKeuT5tWA-zRJYjRL/Z0iUIdFgGPIBwW4ts74G-e)

#### Solo Capture

If you feel confident, you can swap the shield for a greatsword to capture the towers by yourself. Go up in stealth and use `Into the Void` / Focus 4 to bring all the adds together, then use `Illusionary Wave` / Greatsword 5 to push them on the side where there is the most space for them to be outside the circle.

> If a minion spawns, you will have to kill it before you can push them out or portal your group up.

[Example](https://youtu.be/tuTVtLoSq5E)

### Twisted Castle

Make a portal to get to the lower section of `Twisted Castle` to make sure your team don't break their ankles. Aim a dodge roll at the top of the door with full health to survive. Watch your stack of `Madness` to make sure you don't take damage at the same time. (30 and 60 stacks)

[Example](https://youtu.be/EQgqo5XumRI)

### Quadim

For the burn phases, you will be responsible to port your party to the protection pyre.

[Example TODO]()

Another use for the portal is to skip the jumping puzzle after the wyvern phase.

[Example TODO]()

## Tanking

You will be the off tank, when a second tank is required or when the main tank inevitably feeds. Make sure you know how to tank all of the bosses.

### Vale Guardian

- Never get ported (dodge into the wall, use `Blurred Frenzy` or walk out of the blues)
- Use distortion to avoid the green damage (if you are using inspiration)

### Keep Construct

- Kite the boss towards the left wall near the statue that is spawning a spirit to make sure we can quickly cleave it.
- Do not stay in the hitbox when it does the `Phantasmal Blade` attack (Pink portal-like AoE)

### Xera

- The only relevent attack from this boss is the `Blurred Frenzy`. Make sure you save a block for it and never let Xera face the group or she will one-shot dps players.
- Don't let xera walk into any of the shard's massive AoE. Her condition will start turning to boons.
- Make sure the shards are cleared before moving to an edge.
- The idea is to position xera in a way that will not be in a `Gravity Well`, shards or in the center while the laser attack is happening.

[Example](https://youtu.be/7gY746zYcBc)

![xera_tanking_guide.pdf](/images/xera.png "Xera Tank Positioning")

### Deimos

- **Always** take the protective bubble unless the green is taking the entire space (you will never be the one getting oils)
- Use `Well of precognition` or `Echo of Memory` if you must facetank the `Mind Crush` attack
- Position yourself to not get knocked off the platform if you get hit (use geometry)
- Use a signet to share an aegis before the pizza attack. Dodge it if you are unsure about your distortion timing
- Move away from oils. Give some room for the dps players to do their jobs

> Dark Saul will be chasing the player with highest precision, you can swap all your gear to Commander and get aggro.

### Soulless Horror

- Alternate tanking with the other tank; as a rule of thumb, take fixate as soon as your stacks of `Necrosis` wear off (30s after losing fix)
- Aim for both tanks to have up to 2 or 3 stacks of `Necrosis` at all time
- Position the boss halfway between the center and the edge of the arena to make pushing easier and have more time to react to walls
- Move quickly when a wall is going in your direction
- The tank that does not have fixation will be chased by the tormented dead. **Never** split up with the other tank or you will make the pushing impossible.

### Broken King

- Face the boss away from the group
- The attack to avoid is a short range fan of ice shards. Stay further back to not take any damage
- If the boss is dealing damage on a green, face the boss away or take the green yourself using blocks and evades

### Eater of Souls

- Bring the boss on the marking that is lit up green at all times
- The attacks from the boss hurt quite a bit, make sure you block and evade most them

### Dhuum

- The idea is to position dhuum close to the next green
- Make sure you never let dhuum cleave someone taking a green or a downstate
- When soulsplit happens, tank in the center until the dip if there is space
- Immediately bring the boss to the enforcer if one spawns. (at the start or if a big orb is missed)

[Example](https://youtu.be/gh6ohsvXezw)

### Twin Largos

- Drag the boss away from the tornados
- Face the boss away from the group

### Quadim

- Quadim and all the mini-bosses will fixate the closest player.
- Quadim will port player from the mini-bosses hitbox to him whenever he destroys a plateform (learn the timings or have the kiter warn you)

#### Hydra

- Starts at the beginning of the fight
- Attack pattern: `Bite` > `Bite` > `Flame Breath` > `Bite` > `Bite` > `Breakbar` > `Bite` > `Bite` > `Jump`
- Sidestep or block all the attacks (they apply chill, bleed, poison and make your life miserable)
- The jump will go in the direction the hydra is facing. You can move during the last bite attack to decide where the hydra moves to.

[Example TODO]()

#### Destroyer

- Starts when qadim reaches 66% health
- Sidestep the attacks.
- If an attack is impossible to sidestep use a block or an evade.

[Example TODO]()

### Wyvern Matriarch

You are in charge to keep the Wyvern Matriarch busy while the group is handling the Wyvern Patriarch.

- Starts when qadim reaches 33% health
- Stay alive until Zommorros takes over
- Walk out of the flame breath
- Walk out of the `Wing Buffet` and make sure the wyvern is facing away from the group
- Sidestep the `Tail Swipe`
- Avoid the `Slash` by dodging the sideways punch (kockback) and being inside the hitbox to avoid the downward punch.
- Follow and continue tanking if the wyvern moves.

[Example](https://youtu.be/j4cgU3gGjNs)

### Cardinal Adina

- Face the boss away from the group
- Watch out for the cone attack, it will knock you back. Use a block or bring stability from the Chaos traitline
- At 75%, 50% and 25% the stalagmite will explode and do massive damage 1 tile around them. Be far enough to avoid this damage

### Quadim the Peerless

You will be main tank on this fight because it's free for you. Get as much toughness as you need and a shield.

- Use the Special Action Key to link to qadim and be the tank
- Quadim will do a cone attack followed by a barrage of attacks after a few seconds 3 times in a row followed by a road attack. Make sure you have a block ready for all 3 (Ex: `Signet of Inspiration` / `Signet of the Ether` > `Blurred Frenzy`, `Echo of Memory`, `Deja Vu`) 
- Tank on the right side of the pylon so the kiter has safe space on the left side
- Position yourself on the left side between the pylon and the orb during the third barrage of attacks to drop the road (you can stack the roads on top of each other during `Deja Vu`)
- At 20%, make sure you are the first player in the circle to get fixation. You can stay close to qadim and dodge the kockback

[Example TODO]()

## Special Roles

### Bandit Trio

Whenever you see the mortar warning message, use the launchpad and cc the adds preparing the mortar strike after you see a breakbar appear. Use `Into the Void` traited with `Delayed Reaction` to break them all at once.

### Mathias Gabrel

When Matthias gets a protective shield, use `Feedback` to reflect the shards back to break his shield.

### Eye of Judgment / Fate

Stay on top of the wall, collect light orbs before they get stolen by adds, and use the skill 1: `Throw Light` to throw it to your subgroup. Throw the first one on the group and the next ones on the eye.

### Dhuum Backup First Green 2

Make sure to take the first [green 2](/mechanics/dhuum-green.md) on circle to free the kiter during the pre-event.

### Conjured Amalgamate Sword Collection

During the orb collection phase (when an arm dies), the mesmer player is in charge of collecting **all** 15 sword orbs. When you reach 5 stack of swords, position yourself to pick up the next one and cast them on the boss. (this will lock you in place for a second) Keep the 10 remaining stack to use on the arm if the boss is close to phase. (50% and 25%) Otherwise, use the 10 stack when the first 5 run out. The sword orbs start from the left when facing the boss.

> Make sure you do not have a shield stack or you will not be able to pickup swords.
