## Portals

### Spirit Wood

You can portal the team from a capture point to another by abusing the `Adrenal Mushrooms`.

### Spirit Run

After the glide in spirit run, you can portal the team from the capture point directly to the final wall using a double blink.

### Escort

### Twisted Castle

Make a portal to get to the lower section of `Twisted Castle` to make sure your team don't break their ankles. Aim a dodge roll at the top of the door with full health to survive. Watch your stack of `Madness` to make sure you don't take damage at the same time. (30 and 60 stacks)

### Conjured Amalgamate Sword Collection

During the orb collection phase (when an arm dies), the mesmer player is in charge of collecting **all** 15 sword orbs. When you reach 5 stack of swords, position yourself to pick up the next one and cast them on the boss. (this will lock you in place for a second) Keep the 10 remaining stack to use on the arm if the boss is close to phase. (50% and 25%) Otherwise, use the 10 stack when the first 5 run out. The sword orbs start from the left when facing the boss.
