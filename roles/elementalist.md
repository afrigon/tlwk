## Special Roles

### Escort

You are in charge of Glenouche. Use the special action to move her ahead.

### Twisted Castle

For this encounter, swap your warhorn for a dagger to get access to `Ride the Lightning`. (Air Dagger 4)
This will allow you to perform the skip the druid usualy does in pug groups.

### Samarog

You are in charge to keep Rigom [Immobilized](#immobilize). Make sure you keep applying soft crowd control effect onto Guldhem as they will be transfered to Rigom.

### Deimos

Make sure you keep Saul healthy.

### Twin Largos Kite

You should stay further out to kite the steal attack from Kenut. Dodge the hit to avoid getting your boons stolen.

### Quadim Matriarch Tank

When Quadim reaches 33% health, you'll have to tank the matriarch. The most important thing is to stay alive until the Zommoros takes over. Make sure to face the `Wing Buffet` attack away from the group. The Matriarch has a few attacks: walk out of the flame breath and the `Wing Buffet`, walk out of the `Tail Swipe`, avoid the `Slash` by dodging the sideways punch and being inside the hitbox to avoid the downward punch. When the wyvern moves, simply follow it and continue tanking.

## Wing 5

The elementalist will swap to ranger for all of Hall of Chains.

### Soulless Horror Pusher

Your job on this encounter is to push the tormented dead outside the arena. They will be following the tank currently **not** fixated. Position yourself in a way that allows you you to push them out before they reach the group using `Glyph of Tides` and `Point-Blank Shot`.

### Eye of Judgment / Fate

Your job here is to keep the eye stuned using the `Light orb` skill 2: `Flare`. Keep an eye on the stun duration and use a light to refresh it before it runs out. A sigil of paralization and `Moment of Clarity` to extend the duration of the stun.

### Dhuum Kite Green 2

The kiter job on Dhuum is to tap the messengers and take them for a walk away from the group. During the pre-event, be aware of affliction bombs as they might kill you if you are low health. Additionaly, you are in charge of [green 2](/mechanic/dhuum-green.md). Someone else will backup your first green.
