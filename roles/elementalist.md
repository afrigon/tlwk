[Heal Tempest Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PGhEgEWGBrh5wYYlYafd16A-zRRYQhULVNaqqsKjqLg0TAfPIiyGI/NVALtvZB-e)

## Key Skills

- `Aftershock`
- `Flash-Freeze`
- `Eye of the Storm`
- `Feel the Burn`
- `Wash the Pain` Away
- `Rebound`
- `Heat Sync` / Fire Warhorn 4
- `Sand Squall` / Earth Warhorn 4
- `Glyph of Renewal`
- `Overloads`

## Boon Responsability

The elementalist brings protection, regeneration, might, vigor and swiftness for 10 players.

### Protection

This is the most important boon to apply, the elementalist brings protection for the entire squad with `Aftershock` and `Sand Squall`. Any overload will also grant protection.

### Regeneration and Vigor

The regeneration and vigor boons can be provided simply by using `Aftershock`, `Sand Squall` and `Flash-Freeze` since you have the trait `Invigorating Torrents` that gives regeneration and vigor for 10 seconds when you apply an aura.

### Might

Use the fire overload to stack might and blast your fire field using `Aftershock` and `Sand Squell`. Abuse `Heat Sync` / Fire Warhorn 4 to copy **ALL** of your might to nearby allies (adds on top of currently applied might). Bring `Feel the burn` if you dont need superspeed.

### Swiftness

Use `Eye of the storm` and swap to air from time to time to keep a good uptime on swiftness. If you don't need cc, `Cyclone` can be used for more swiftness.

### Extension

One of your most powerful ability is `Sand Squall` to extend all boons currently applied to everyone in the squad for 3 seconds.

## Healing

The elementalist will be in charge of all the healing on most bosses. Make sure to go into water regularly to refresh the `Soothing mist` buff on everyone. In high pressure situation, use `Wash the pain away`, `Water Globe` / Water Warhorn 5 > `Frozen Burst` / Water Dagger 3 or water overload for a burst of heal.

## Crowd Control

- `Cyclone` / Air Warhorn 4 (up to 9 hits of 150)
- `Transmute Lightning` / Air Dagger 3 (100)
- `Tidal Surge` / Water Warhorn 4 (150)

### Immobilize

- `Aftershock`
- `Earthen Rush` / Earth Dagger 3

### Cripple

- `Aftershock`
- `Ring of Earth` / Earth Dagger 2

### Chill

- `Flash-Freeze`
- `Frozen Burst` / Water Dagger 3

## Magnetic Aura

- `Aftershock`
- `Sand Squall`
- `Rebound`

> Be sure to never grant magnetic aura on fights where reflect can be bad like cairn and matthias.

## Superspeed

While superspeed can be very good on most fights, be extremely careful to not give this buff on fights where it could kill your teamates like Cardinal Adina or Escort.

## Rebound

This is one of your strongest skill, it can save the group from a wipe in many cases like:

- Deimos: Mind Crush
- Conjured Amalgamate: Clap
- your mom: Clap
- Quadim: Failed CC
- Cardinal Sabir: Shockwave

## Special Roles

### Escort

You are in charge of Glenouche. Use the special action to move her ahead.

### Twisted Castle

For this encounter, swap your warhorn for a dagger to get access to `Ride the Lightning`. (Air Dagger 4)
This will allow you to perform the skip the druid usualy does in pug groups.

### Samarog

You are in charge to keep Rigom [Immobilized](#immobilize). Make sure you keep applying soft crowd control effect onto Guldhem as they will be transfered to Rigom.

### Deimos

Make sure you keep Saul healthy.

### Twin Largos Kite

You should stay further out to kite the steal attack from Kenut. Dodge the hit to avoid getting your boons stolen.

### Quadim Matriarch Tank

- Starts when quadim reaches 33% health
- Stay alive until Zommorros takes over
- Walk out of the flame breath
- Walk out of the `Wing Buffet` and make sure the wyvern is facing away from the group
- Sidestep the `Tail Swipe`
- Avoid the `Slash` by dodging the sideways punch (kockback) and being inside the hitbox to avoid the downward punch.
- Follow and continue tanking if the wyvern moves.

## Wing 5

The elementalist will swap to ranger for all of Hall of Chains.

### Soulless Horror Pusher

Your job on this encounter is to push the tormented dead outside the arena. They will be following the tank currently **not** fixated. Position yourself in a way that allows you you to push them out before they reach the group using `Glyph of Tides` and `Point-Blank Shot`.

### Eye of Judgment / Fate

Your job here is to keep the eye stuned using the `Light orb` skill 2: `Flare`. Keep an eye on the stun duration and use a light to refresh it before it runs out. Use a sigil of paralization and `Moment of Clarity` to extend the duration of the stun.

### Dhuum Kite Green 2

The kiter job on Dhuum is to tap the messengers and take them for a walk away from the group. During the pre-event, be aware of affliction bombs as they might kill you if you are low health. Additionaly, you are in charge of [green 2](/mechanics/dhuum-green.md). Someone else will backup your first green.
