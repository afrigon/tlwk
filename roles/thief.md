## Scecial Roles

### Samarog Door

Please open the door :peepoShy:

### Quadim Lamp

A thief player will have to do the [lamp](/mechanics/quadim-lamp.md) for us to progress the fight. Make sure you take `Improvisation` to have 2 `Throw Magnetic Bomb`. You can pre-steal on Quadim at the start of the fight. If you have to do the lamp alone, take `Invigorating Precision` to help you stay alive.

[Example]()

### Quadim Kite

You need to stamp on Quadim's platform in order to prevent him from destroying the arena. While you kite, your job is to kill the slublings trying to reach the boss and stay alive at all cost. The attack pattern goes like this:

```
Flame Slash x2 > Flame Wave > Flame Slash > Fire Dance
Flame Slash x2 > Flame Wave > Flame Slash > Fire Dance
Flame Slash x4 > Shattering Impact
```

It is extremely important you dodge the `Flame Slash` and the `Shattering Impact`. the rest of the attack can be avoided by standing far in the blue sections. Change platform after every `Shattering Impact`.
