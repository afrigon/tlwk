## Special Roles

### Samarog Door

Please open the door :peepoShy:

### Qadim Lamp

A thief player will have to do the [lamp](/mechanics/qadim-lamp.md) for us to progress the fight. Make sure you take `Improvisation` to have 2 `Throw Magnetic Bomb`. You can pre-steal on Quadim at the start of the fight. If you have to do the lamp alone, take `Invigorating Precision` to help you stay alive.

[Example TODO]()

### Qadim Kite

You need to stand on Qadim's platform in order to prevent him from destroying the arena. While you kite, your job is to kill the slublings trying to reach the boss and stay alive at all cost. The attack pattern goes like this:

```
Flame Slash x2 > Flame Wave > Flame Slash > Fire Dance
Flame Slash x2 > Flame Wave > Flame Slash > Fire Dance
Flame Slash x4 > Shattering Impact
```

It is extremely important you dodge the `Flame Wave` (since it knocks back) and the `Shattering Impact`. The rest of the attack can be avoided by standing far in the blue sections. Change platform after every `Shattering Impact`.

### Quadim the Peerless Kite

Use the Special Action Key to link to one of the 3 pylons.
Use `Shadowstep` to catch the orbs clockwise and bring them back to the pylon.
You can leave your pylon for only a few seconds before Qadim reclaims your pylon.
At 40%, 30% and 20% Qadim rushes a pylon (north, west, east respectively) and destroys it. Watch the boss health to avoid getting killed by this attack.
After your pylon is destroyed, join the group and finish the fight as a dps.
