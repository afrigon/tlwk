# Engineer

- [Heal Mechanist Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PexAk67lNw8YtMXWKeyTfRVA-zRRYjhi6UNaL3wKkWSgqDh0LAfPIhyW4t0+mF-e)

## Key Skills

- `Crisis Zone` / Mech F2
- `Barrier Burst` / Mech F3
- `Barrier Blast`
- `Barrier Signet`
- `Med Kit`

## Boon Responsability

The engineer brings might, alacrity, regeneration, fury, swiftness, and protection.

### Alacrity

You grant Alacrity with the trait `Mech Frame: Channeling Conduits` everytime you apply barrier (`Barrier Burst` / Mech F3, `Barrier Signet` and `Barrier Blast` / last hit of your auto attack chain). Your Mech also gives alac when using `Crisis Zone` / Mech F2

### Might

Most of the might is generated by the Mech via `Barrier Burst` / Mech F3 and the trait `Mech Arms: High-Impact Drivers` when the mech hits. You need to help your mech by using elixir such as `Elixir Shell` / Mortar Kit 5, `Super Elixir` / Elixir Gun 5 and `Acid Bomb` / Elixir Gun 4 to proc the trait `HGH`.

> You can cancel the leap of `Acid Bomb` / Elixir Gun 4 by pressing the swap weapon button right after.

### Protection

Your protection comes from `Crisis Zone` / Mech F2 and the trait `Ally Ward` when you use a shield skill.

### Fury

You give fury with `Barrier Burst` / Mech F3.

## Crowd Control

- `Rocket Fist Prototype` / Mace 3 (100)
- `Magnetic Inversion` / Shield 4 (150)
- `Throw Shield` / Shield 5 (100)

## Blocks

- `Static Shield` Shield 5 is a block

## Tanking

You will be the main tank. Make sure you know how to tank all of the bosses.

### Vale Guardian

- Never get ported (dodge into the wall, use `Static Shield` or walk out of the blues)

### Keep Construct

- Kite the boss towards the left wall near the statue that is spawning a spirit to make sure we can quickly cleave it.
- Do not stay in the hitbox when it does the `Phantasmal Blade` attack (Pink portal-like AoE)

### Xera

- The only relevent attack from this boss is the `Blurred Frenzy`. Make sure you save a block for it and never let Xera face the group or she will one-shot dps players.
- Don't let xera walk into any of the shard's massive AoE. Her condition will start turning to boons.
- Make sure the shards are cleared before moving to an edge.
- The idea is to position xera in a way that will not be in a `Gravity Well`, shards or in the center while the laser attack is happening.

### Deimos

- **Always** take the protective bubble unless the green is taking the entire space (you will never be the one getting oils)
- Use `Static Shield` if you must facetank the `Mind Crush` attack
- Position yourself to not get knocked off the platform if you get hit (use geometry)
- You can save your `Crisis Zone` / Mech F2 to share an aegis before the pizza attack. Dodge it if you are unsure about timing
- Move away from oils. Give some room for the dps players to do their jobs

### Soulless Horror

- Alternate tanking with the other tank; as a rule of thumb, take fixate as soon as your stacks of `Necrosis` wear off (30s after losing fix)
- Aim for both tanks to have up to 2 or 3 stacks of `Necrosis` at all time
- Position the boss halfway between the center and the edge of the arena to make pushing easier and have more time to react to walls
- Move quickly when a wall is going in your direction
- The tank that does not have fixation will be chased by the tormented dead. **Never** split up with the other tank or you will make the pushing impossible.

### Broken King

- Face the boss away from the group
- The attack to avoid is a short range fan of ice shards. Stay further back to not take any damage
- If the boss is dealing damage on a green, face the boss away or take the green yourself using blocks and evades

### Eater of Souls

- Bring the boss on the marking that is lit up green at all times
- The attacks from the boss hurt quite a bit, make sure you block and evade most them

### Dhuum

- The idea is to position dhuum close to the next green
- Make sure you never let dhuum cleave someone taking a green or a downstate
- When soulsplit happens, tank in the center until the dip if there is space
- Immediately bring the boss to the enforcer if one spawns. (at the start or if a big orb is missed)

### Quadim

- Quadim and all the mini-bosses will fixate the closest player.
- Quadim will port player from the mini-bosses hitbox to him whenever he destroys a plateform (learn the timings or have the kiter warn you)

#### Hydra

- Starts at the beginning of the fight
- Attack pattern: `Bite` > `Bite` > `Flame Breath` > `Bite` > `Bite` > `Breakbar` > `Bite` > `Bite` > `Jump`
- Sidestep or block all the attacks (they apply chill, bleed, poison and make your life miserable)
- The jump will go in the direction the hydra is facing. You can move during the last bite attack to decide where the hydra moves to.

[Example TODO]()

#### Destroyer

- Starts when qadim reaches 66% health
- Sidestep the attacks.
- If an attack is impossible to sidestep use a block or an evade.

[Example TODO]()

#### Wyvern Patriarch

- Starts when qadim reaches 33% health
- Walk out of the flame breath
- Sidestep the `Tail Swipe`
- Avoid the `Slash` by dodging the sideways punch (kockback) and by being inside the hitbox to avoid the downward punch.
- Follow and continue tanking if the wyvern moves.

[Example TODO]()

### Cardinal Adina

- Face the boss away from the group
- Watch out for the cone attack, it will knock you back. Use a block or bring stability from the Chaos traitline
- At 75%, 50% and 25% the stalagmite will explode and do massive damage 1 tile around them. Be far enough to avoid this damage

### Quadim the Peerless

The mesmer player will tank on this fight because it is a lot simpler for them.

## Special Roles

### Eye of judgment / Fate

Stay on top of the wall, collect light orbs before they get stolen by adds, and use the skill 1: `Throw Light` to throw them to your party. Throw the first one on the group and the next ones on the eye.

### Conjured Amalgamate Shield Collection

During the orb collection phase (when an arm dies), the guardian player is in charge of collecting **all** 15 shield orbs to make sure none of them reach the boss; You must then use your 10 stacks of `Conjured Shield` to protect the group from the next junk torrent. 

> Make sure you do not have a sword stack or you will not be able to pickup shields.
