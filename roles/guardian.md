# Guardian

- [Condition Quickness Firebrand Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PWxAc+tlRweYdYmYRbt98B-zRJYyRH/ZkgKoDJgYPIiQ6fE7gDgtwz0G-e)) to be played in most places
- [Heal Tank Firebrand Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PWxAk6ZlRweYaMMmJmyWrPdA-zRJYjRHfZUdKkeF47BJU2Dvl23sA-e)

## Key Skills

- `Stand Your Ground!`
- `Mantra of Liberation`
- `Sanctuary`
- `Advance!`

## Boon Responsability

### Protection and Resolution

You have access to some protection and resolution with `Mantra of Solace`.

### Quickness

The guardian player brings quickness
for their subgroup with `Mantra of Potence`,
`Mantra of Solace` (with `Liberator's Vow`).

> `Liberator's Vow` has a recharge of 7 seconds so
  pace its usage to maximize quickness output

### Stability

`Stand Your Ground!` and `Mantra of Liberation` will negate the crowd control from the following attacks for your party.

- Gorseval's `Spectral Impact` (slam)
- Slothasor's post-`Narcolepsy` fear (when defiance bar is broken)
- Matthias' `Unbalanced` (when moving with 10 stacks of `Downpour`)
- Keep Construct's `Tower Drop` (orange circle)
- Cairn's `Spatial Manipulation` (green circle)
- Samarog's `Prisoner Sweep` and `Shockwave`
- Conjured Amalgamate's `Pulverize` (ground slam)
- Twin Largos' `Geyser` (large orange circle)
- Qadim's Greater Magma Elemantals' `Seismic Stomp` (orange circle)
- Adina's Hand of Eruption's `Stone Claw` (knockback projectiles)
- Sabir's Voltaic Wisp's `Electrospark` (small orange circles)
- Qadim The Peerless' `Force of Retaliation` (shockwave)

> Careful, stability will get corrupted into fear by the evolved slublings at Slothasor and the scythes on Soulless Horror.

### Aegis

use `Advance!` to protect your party from various hits like Deimos' `Demonic Shock Wave` (pizza slices) and its final phase slams.

## Crowd Control

 - `Sanctuary` (up to 7 hits of 150)
 - `Blazing Edge` / Axe 3 (150)
 - `Tome of Justice` > `Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke` (150)

## Special Roles

### Samarog

Samarog fixates on the first player it sees, then on the furthest player away after its defiance bar is broken. You should try to bait fixate for your group and guide the boss to the center of the arena. Dodge backward after the rampage to hopefully get fixate again.

### Matthias Backup Reflect

If the Mesmer fails to reflect the `Blood Shards`, wait for Matthias to start shooting again, then use your `Tome of Courage` > `Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark`.

### Qadim The Peerless Third LÃ¤mp

When Qadim reaches 33% health, go in the [lamp](/mechanics/quadim-lamp.md) to provide stability to your team while fighting the Giant Veterans by the end of the maze.

### River

Protect Desmina from Hollowed Bombers with Aegis, drop lightning on Desmina to kill Spirit Hordes chasing you while fighting the pull from the Spatial Rifts.

### Dhuum Green 3

You're in charge of [green 3](/mechanics/dhuum-green.md).
