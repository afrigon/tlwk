# Guardian

- [Condition Quickness Firebrand Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PWxAc+tlRweYdYmYRbt90B-zRJYmR3/ZkgKoDJgYPIiQ6fE7gDgtwzZF-e)) to be played in most places
- [Heal Tank Firebrand Build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PWxAk6ZlRweYaMMmJmyWrPdA-zRJYjRHfZUdKkeF47BJU2Dvl23sA-e) for Wing 5 and Twin Largos

## Key Skills

- `Stand Your Ground!`
- `Mantra of Liberation`
- `Sanctuary`
- `Advance!`

## Boon Responsability

### Quickness

The guardian player brings quickness
for their subgroup with `Mantra of Potence`,
`Mantra of Solace` (with `Liberator's Vow` and `Stalwart Speed`)
and `Mantra of Liberation` (with `Stalwart Speed`). 

> Both quickness traits (`Liberator's Vow` and `Stalwart Speed`)
  have a recharge of 7 seconds so
  pace their usage to maximize quickness output

### Stability

`Stand Your Ground!` will negate the crowd control from the following attacks for your whole squad.

- Gorseval's `Spectral Impact` (slam)
- Slothasor's post-`Narcolepsy` fear (when defiance bar is broken)
- Matthias' `Unbalanced` (when moving with 10 stacks of `Downpour`)
- Keep Construct's `Tower Drop` (orange circle)
- Cairn's `Spatial Manipulation` (green circle)
- Samarog's `Prisoner Sweep` and `Shockwave`
- Conjured Amalgamate's `Pulverize` (ground slam)
- Twin Largos' `Geyser` (large orange circle)
- Qadim's Greater Magma Elemantals' `Seismic Stomp` (orange circle)
- Adina's Hand of Eruption's `Stone Claw` (knockback projectiles)
- Sabir's Voltaic Wisp's `Electrospark` (small orange circles)
- Qadim The Peerless' `Force of Retaliation` (shockwave)

> Remove stability from your build as it will get corrupted into fear by the evolved slublings at Slothasor and the scythes on Soulless Horror

### Aegis

`Advance!` will provide aegis more reliably than `Mantra of Solace` for Deimos' `Demonic Shock Wave` (pizza slices) and its final phase slams.

> This is due to the way mantras prioritize off-group players and other allied NPCs within the cone in front of the caster over same-group players in the area of effect around the caster.

## Crowd Control

 - `Sanctuary` (up to 7 hits of 150)
 - `Blazing Edge` / Axe 3 (150)
 - `Tome of Justice` > `Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke` (150)

## Tanking

### Samarog

Samarog fixates on the first player it sees, then on the furthest player away after its defiance bar is broken. You should try to bait fixate for your group and guide the boss to the center of the arena. Dodge backward after the rampage to hopefully get fixate again.

### Soulless Horror

- Alternate tanking with the other tank; as a rule of thumb, take fixate as soon as your stacks of `Necrosis` wear off (30s after losing fix)
- Aim for both tanks to have up to 2 or 3 stacks of `Necrosis` at all time
- Position the boss halfway between the center and the edge of the arena to make pushing easier and have more time to react to walls
- Move quickly when a wall is going in your direction
- The tank that does not have fixation will be chased by the tormented dead. **Never** split up with the other tank or you will make the pushing impossible.

### Twin Largos

- You're responsible for healing and protection uptime on left side (Nikare)
- Prevent large AoE knockbacks with `Stand Your Ground!`
- Stunbreak bubbled players from the `Aquatic Detainment` with `Mantra of Liberation`
- Block the `Aquatic Barrage` with your `Shield of Absorption` (Shield 5)
- Face the boss away from the group

## Special Roles

### Matthias Backup Reflect

If the Mesmer fails to reflect the `Blood Shards`, wait for Matthias to start shooting again, then use your `Tome of Courage` > `Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark`.

### Conjured Amalgamate Shield Collection

During the orb collection phase (when an arm dies), the guardian player is in charge of collecting **all** 15 shield orbs to make sure none of them reach the boss; You can help yourself with your `Tome of Courage` for self resistance, swiftness and stability. You must then use your 10 stacks of `Conjured Shield` to protect the group from the next junk torrent.

### Qadim The Peerless Third LÃ¤mp

When Qadim reaches 33% health, go in the [lamp](/mechanics/quadim-lamp.md) to provide stability to your team while fighting the Giant Veterans by the end of the maze.

### River

Protect Desmina from Hollowed Bombers with Aegis, drop lightning on Desmina to kill Spirit Hordes chasing you while fighting the pull from the Spatial Rifts.

### Eye of Judgment / Fate

Stay on top of the wall, collect light orbs before they get stolen by adds, and use the skill 1: `Throw Light` to throw them to your subgroup. Throw the first one on the group and the next ones on the eye.

### Dhuum Green 3

You're in charge of [green 3](/mechanics/dhuum-green.md).
