# Guardian

- [Condition Quickness Firebrand](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PWxAc+tlRweYdYmYRbt90B-zRJYmR3/ZkgKoDJgYPIiQ6fE7gDgtwzZF-e) to be played in most places
- [Heal Tank Firebrand]() for Wing 5 and Twin Largos

## Key Skills

- `Stand Your Ground!`
- `Mantra of Liberation`
- `Sanctuary`
- `Advance!`

## Boon Responsability

### Quickness

The guardian player brings quickness
for their subgroup with `Mantra of Potence`,
`Mantra of Solace` (with `Liberator's Vow` and `Stalwart Speed`)
and either `Feel My Wrath!` or `Mantra of Liberation` (with `Stalwart Speed`). 

> Both quickness traits (`Liberator's Vow` and `Stalwart Speed`)
  have a recharge of 7 seconds so
  pace their usage to maximize quickness output

### Stability

`Stand Your Ground!` will negate the crowd control from the following attacks for your whole squad.

- Gorseval's `Spectral Impact` (slam)
- Slothasor's post-`Narcolepsy` fear (when defiance bar is broken)
- Matthias' `Unbalanced` (when moving with 10 stacks of `Downpour`)
- Keep Construct's `Tower Drop` (orange circle)
- Cairn's `Spatial Manipulation` (green circle)
- Samarog's `Prisoner Sweep` and `Shockwave`
- Conjured Amalgamate's `Pulverize` (ground slam)
- Qadim's Greater Magma Elemantals' `Seismic Stomp` (orange circle)
- Adina's Hand of Eruption's `Stone Claw` (knockback projectiles)
- Sabir's Voltaic Wisp's `Electrospark` (small orange circles)
- Qadim The Peerless' `Force of Retaliation` (shockwave)

### Aegis

`Advance!` will provide aegis more reliably than `Mantra of Solace` for Deimos' `Demonic Shock Wave` (pizza slices) and its final phase slams.

> This is due to the way mantras prioritize off-group players and other allied NPCs within the cone in front of the caster over same-group players in the area of effect around the caster.

## Crowd Control

 - `Sanctuary` (up to 7 hits of 150)
 - `Blazing Edge` / Axe 3 (150)
 - `Tome of Justice` > `Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke` (150)

## Tanking

### Souless Horror

### Twin Largos

## Special Roles

### Matthias Backup Reflect

If the Mesmer fails to reflect the `Blood Shards`, wait for Matthias to start shooting again, then use your `Tome of Courage` > `Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark`.

### Conjured Amalgamate Shield Collection

During the orb collection phase (when an arm dies), the guardian player is in charge of collecting **all** 15 shield orbs to make sure none of them reach the boss. You must then use your 10 stacks of `Conjured Shield` to protect the group from the next junk torrent. 

### Qadim The Peerless Third LÃ¤mp

When Qadim reaches 33% health, go in the lamp to provide stability to your team while fighting the Giant Veterans by the end of the maze.

### Eye of Judgment / Fate

Stay on top of the wall, collect light orbs before they get stolen by adds, and use the skill 1: `Throw Light` to throw them to your subgroup.

### Dhuum Green 3

You're in charge of [green 3](/mechanic/dhuum-green.md).
