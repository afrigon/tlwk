## Key Skills

- Stand Your Ground
- Mantra of Liberation
- Sanctuary
- Advance
- Wall of Reflection

## Boon Responsability

### Quickness

The guardian player brings quickness for their subgroup via the `Mantra of Potence`, the `Mantra of Solace` (thanks to `Liberator's Vow` and `Stalwart Speed`) and either `Feel My Wrath!` or `Mantra of Liberation` (thanks to `Stalwart Speed`). 

> Both quickness traits (`Liberator's Vow` and `Stalwart Speed`) have a recharge of 7 seconds so try to pace their usage to maximize quickness output

### Stability

`Stand Your Ground!` will negate the following attacks for your whole squad

- Gorseval's `Spectral Impact` (slam)
- Keep Construct's `Tower Drop` (orange circle)
- Cairn's `Spatial Manipulation` (greens)

### Aegis

their subgroup via `Mantra of Solace` and `Advance` when appropriate.
