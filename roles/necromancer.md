## Epidemic

`Epidemic` is a key skill on many bosses.
It is used to cleave adds and
to boost target dps by bouncing conditions
back to the boss.

Targets:

- Vale Guardian: Seekers
- Gorseval: Spirits and Orbs
- Sabetha: Bandits and Karde's Flame Turrets
- Slothasor: Slublings (**NOT FRIENDLY SLUBLING**)
- Keep Construct: Mesmer Projections

- Soulless Horror: Tormented Deads
- Conjured Amalgamate: Swords and Shields

### Epidemic Bouncing

One necromancer will be designated as "epi out".
Their job is to copy conditions from boss to other targets.
This player must be vocal so the rest of the team can
use `Epidemic` to bounce conditions off the other targets back to the boss.
Be careful with skill retargeting.

## Special Roles

### Sabetha Flak Kite

The designated "epi out" will kite flak on Sabetha.
Hangout on the west side of the platform to bait sapper bombs.
Be ready to throw to players handling cannons.

> Sabetha stops throwing flak
  while off the platform
  and during flamewall.

### Soulless Horror Epidemic

Be careful with "epi out" on Soulless Horror.
Coordinate with the pusher to time killing the tormented dead,
ideally off the platform.

### Quadim Lamp

2 necromancer player will be designated to go in the [lamp](/mechanics/quadim-lamp.md)

### Cardinal Adina

Instead of `Epidemic`, the "epi out" takes `Sand Swell`.
Use `Sand Swell` to portal the party
between the 2nd and 3rd hands in the split phases.

### Quadim the Peerless Kite

#### Build Changes

- `Parasitic Contagion` (Curses traitline)
- `Flesh Golem`
- `Sand Swell`

Use the Special Action Key to link to one of the 3 pylons.
Use `Sand Swell` to catch the orbs clockwise and bring them back to the pylon.
You can leave your pylon for only a few seconds before Qadim reclaims your pylon.
At 40%, 30% and 20% Qadim rushes a pylon (north, west, east respectively) and destroys it. Watch the boss health to avoid getting killed by this attack.
After your pylon is destroyed, join the group and finish the fight as a dps.
