### Cardinal Adina

Use `Sand Swell` to portal the party
between the 2nd and 3rd hands in the split phases.

### Quadim the Peerless Kite

#### Build Changes

- `Flesh Golem`
- `Sand Swell`

Use the Special Action Key to link to one of the 3 pylons.
Use `Sand Swell` to catch the orbs clockwise and bring them back to the pylon.
You can leave your pylon for only a few seconds before Qadim reclaims your pylon.
At 40%, 30% and 20% Qadim rushes a pylon (north, west, east respectively) and destroys it. Watch the boss health to avoid getting killed by this attack.
After your pylon is destroyed, join the group and finish the fight as a dps.
