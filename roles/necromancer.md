## Key Skills

- [Epidemic](#epidemic)
- Specral grasp
- Flesh Golem
- Sand Swell
- Trail of Anguish
- Well of Darkness

## Crowd Control

- Oppresive Collapse / Torch 5 (200)
- Wail of Doom / Warhorn 4 (200)
- Garish Pillar / F4 (200)
- Spectral Grasp (150-750)
- Flesh Golem (600/800/1000 depending on the size of the hitbox)

## Epidemic

Epidemic is a key skill to use on most bosses. It is very useful to cleave other targets or to boost your target damage by bouncing the conditions from anything back to the boss.

> Be very careful about the friendly slubling in Slothasor.

### Epi Out

A necromancer will be designated as the "epi out". They have the job to copy conditions from boss to any other target. This player needs to be vocal about this so the rest of the team can use Epidemic to bounce the condition back to the boss.

A few good candidate for this strategy:

- Vale Guardian's Seekers
- Mursaat Overseer's Jade Scouts
- Soulless Horror's Tormented Deads

## Special Roles

### Sabetha Flak Kite

The designated "epi out" player will have to kite the flak on Sabetha. Simply hangout on the west side of the plateform. By being one the west side, you will most likely get the sapper bombs. Be ready to throw the players handling canons.

> Sabetha will stop throwing flak when she is not on the platform and during her flamewall attack.

### Soulless Horror Epidemic

Be careful with the "epi out" on Soulless Horror. You want to coordinate with the pusher to make sure you dont kill the tormented dead too soon. It needs to die outside the platform idealy. All the other necromancer should use epidemic on the tormented dead to maximize boss damage (be careful with skill retargeting).

### Quadim the Peerless Kite

#### Build Changes

- Parasitic Contagion (curses traitline)
- Flesh Golem
- Sand Swell

Your job is to link to one of the 3 pylons. Use Sand Swell to quickly grap the orb clockwise and bring it back to the pylon. You have a few seconds to do this until quadim claims your pylon back. At 40%, 30% and 20% quadim will rush to a pylon (north, west, east respectively) and destroy it. Watch the bosses health to avoid getting killed by the pylon's destruction. After your pylon is destroyed, go to the group and finish the fight as a dps.

> Make sure you press the special action once to enable the flux capacitor and link to pylons.
